# Dance Finder

This is a simple React app that uses the Spotify APIs to get the song analytics of a searched song title and tells you what ballroom dances correlate to the song data.

**Note:** Please pardon the ugliness of the front end, I'm still learning React :) 

This app is deployed via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dance-finder). Deployment commences off of commits to the `main` branch.
